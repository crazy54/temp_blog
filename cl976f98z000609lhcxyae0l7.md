# Return to Normal: Why I Have Been Gone and When New Material is Coming!

Well, sorry to interrupt the normal cadence of posting. I wanted to share quickly why I have not posted in a while and when you can expect new articles to return. 📰

Few weeks ago, I woke up in severe pain - worse than anything I have ever had in my life. I was taken to the Emergency room to be evaluated and I had a case of pancreatitis which was causing my problem. I was hospitalized for a week on tons of fluids, antibiotics and pain medication to keep me as comfortable as I could be. 🤕

I wanted to blog while there, but I had no will to do so as I was sleeping a majority of my stay. The doctors took wonderful care of me and my wife (mental care is important for family members!) and I was able to go home at the end of the week and took a few days off to work myself back up to "normal" so I could work a few half days then this week I have been working full days. 

I am sorry 🙏🏻 for not posting sooner, but I wanted to get an idea of when I would be able to start blogging again before I told my story. So, I plan to try to get something out to the blog early next week - sometime around October 17th/18th you can expect a great article I have brewing involving DataDog 🐕‍🦺 and monitoring. 

So get ready🚦- I am back, and I came up with tons of ideas to place on my Kanban idea board to write up for aptgetops.tech and I am excited to get them done and in your hands. 

I hope you have a good last bit of the week, and an amazing weekend. Take care, and I will be posting soon.👨🏻‍💻 💖
