## DONE! Move Complete. WELCOME!

**This is apt-get-ops**, a newsletter you can use as the Ops Bible for SRE/Operations/Architecture Roles in Technology. As someone who has worked in many different roles over the last decade and a half, I can provide insight into management issues, what tech to learn _**today**_ which is vital fo_r **tomorrow**_.

This newsletter will contain the top headlines to read, articles written by myself about companies/SaaS/PaaS/etc. that will help you in your day to day role, and impress those around you, including your manager.

In the future, I will have a show and tell special edition newsletter once a month where I can get someone to share with you the cool and cool tech they are implementing in their job, so you can learn about the tech being used across the web and on prem.

Watch out, subscribe, and get ready. This is going to be a wild ride that you will not want to miss out on. **The first newsletter will come out on Friday, June 10, 2022**. I am also getting the site together, and re-instating the apt-get-ops domain.
